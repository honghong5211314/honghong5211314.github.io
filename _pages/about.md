I am **Shuo Zhao (赵朔)**, a sophomore undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at [Yanshan University](https://www.ysu.edu.cn/).

My academic interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Embedded Robotics**. Specifically, I am enthusiastic about designing lightweight deep learning models (CNNs, Transformers) and deploying them on edge devices for real-time perception.

Currently, I am looking for **Research Internship** opportunities. I possess strong English proficiency (TOEFL 107, GRE 335) and am ready for international academic collaboration.
